# Why Use the dynamic_cast Operator?
The dynamic_cast operator in C++ is used to safely cast pointers or references within an inheritance hierarchy, ensuring the casted result is of the correct type. Here’s why we use dynamic_cast in your code:

## Purpose of dynamic_cast
In this exercise, you have a Base pointer or reference that points to an object of a derived type (A, B, or C). You need to identify the actual type of the object (whether it's an instance of A, B, or C). However, since you're only given a Base pointer or reference, the compiler doesn’t know the actual derived type at compile time.

dynamic_cast helps by checking the runtime type of the object. It allows you to:
- Confirm the type of a Base pointer or reference before casting it to a derived type.
- Avoid unsafe or incorrect casts, which could lead to undefined behavior.

## How dynamic_cast Works
1. **For Pointers**: When dynamic_cast is applied to a pointer, if the object is not of the specified type, it returns a **NULL pointer**.

2. For References: When applied to a reference, if the cast fails, **dynamic_cast throws a bad_cast exception** (though in your exercise, this part isn’t needed as we’re only using it to check type validity).


## Example in The Code
In the code, dynamic_cast is used to check if the Base pointer or reference points to an instance of A, B, or C. Here’s what happens:
```C++
void identify(Base* p)
{
	if (dynamic_cast<A*>(p))
		std::cout << PURPLE << "A" << RESET << std::endl;
	else if (dynamic_cast<B*>(p))
		std::cout << PURPLE << "B" << RESET << std::endl;
	else if (dynamic_cast<C*>(p))
		std::cout << PURPLE << "C" << RESET << std::endl;
	else
		std::cout << PURPLE << "Unknown" << RESET << std::endl;
}
```
For each dynamic_cast<A*>(p), dynamic_cast<B*>(p), and dynamic_cast<C*>(p):
- dynamic_cast attempts to cast the Base pointer p to a pointer of type A, B, or C.
- If the cast is successful, dynamic_cast returns a non-null pointer to the derived type, and the corresponding if block executes.
- If the cast fails (meaning p doesn’t point to the requested type), dynamic_cast returns NULL, and the code moves to the next type check.


## Why Not Use static_cast?
static_cast is a compile-time cast and does not check the actual type at runtime. Using static_cast here could lead to unsafe casts and undefined behavior if p doesn’t actually point to an instance of the requested type. With dynamic_cast, you get a runtime type check, which prevents incorrect casting and makes the code safer.
